A handy, printable, A4 flyer with frequently asked questions about electric vehicles. Answers things like:
* What's the range of an EV?
* How often do you need to charge an EV?
* How long does it take to charge?
* How much does it cost to run?
* What are things only EV's can do?
* How long does the battery last?

If you're constantly being asked those questions as an EV driver, feel free to print this out, and hand out to people who are interested in EV's.

## Building

The flyer is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and rendered to PDF using [`electron-pdf`](https://github.com/fraserxu/electron-pdf).

To develop locally and preview in the browser, start a dev server with:
```
npm run dev
```
To build an actual PDF, set the desired language and run the build command:
```
export VITE_LANGUAGE=en
npm run pdf:build
```
The resulting file will be in the `build` directory.
